    <h2>Character Bio</h2>
    <p>
        CYPH-ELITE has overall a basic personality. His delivery when giving out comments is 
        neutral, although it is greatly daunting given him having a deeper voice than his 
        predecessors. Despite this, the facial expressions he makes when giving out comments say 
        otherwise, and help with his commanding voice.
