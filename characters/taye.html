    <h2>Character Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Taye presents herself with lots of spunky attitude. 
	She says stuff the way she sees it, and does not hold back in expressing it. 
	She is an inspiration to her younger sister Li'l T, who wants to follow in her footsteps, 
	but she also makes sure to show Li'l T to think with her head when speaking, 
	as some of the statements she makes come off with little thought and big ambition.
