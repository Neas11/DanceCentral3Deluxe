    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
      There is no official venue specifically named "The Black Venue" or similar.
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Lowdown (Dance Central 2):</strong> This venue is set in an 
	underground subway station and train car, featuring an urban, 
	slightly gritty aesthetic that is more dimly lit than the others. It is 
	the home base for the Hi-Def crew.</li>
	<li><strong> The Airship (Dance Central 2):</strong> Dr. Tan's mobile headquarters 
	has an ominous, high-tech, and metallic interior that serves as 
	the backdrop for the final boss battle of the game. It is designed 
	to be imposing and dark, in contrast to the tropical or vibrant 
	daytime venues.</li>
	<li><strong> Crow's Nest (Dance Central 3):</strong> This venue is a large outdoor 
	arena with a gothic, industrial feel, serving as the stage for the 
	antagonistic Murder of Crows crew. It has a darker atmosphere 
	than most other locations.</li>
