    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Airship is a major unlockable venue featured in Dance Central 2.
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Theme:</strong> The venue is a massive, high-tech aircraft that serves 
	as the mobile base for the series' primary antagonist, Dr. Tan.</li>
	<li><strong> Dynamic Setting:</strong> Like other venues in the second game, it 
	alternates between two areas: the main control station and a 
	platform on the exterior underside of the ship, which features 
	large robotic arms.</li>
	<li><strong> Associated Crew:</strong> It is the home stage for D-Cypher, a crew of 
	robots (CYPH-56 and CYPH-78) created by Dr. Tan to defeat the 
	player.</li>
    </p>
