    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
       High Tide is a primary venue featured in Dance Central 2.
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Locations:</strong> The venue is unique because it alternates between 
	two distinct areas: a beach and a nearby basketball court.</li>
	<li><strong> Associated Crew:</strong> It is the home venue for Riptide, the athletic 
	and sporty crew represented by the characters Bodie and 
	Emilia.</li>
	<li><strong> Availability:</strong> High Tide is available from the start of Dance 
	Central 2.</li>
	<li><strong> Role in Gameplay:</strong> In the game's "Crew Challenge" (story 
	mode), High Tide is typically the first venue players visit to begin 
	their career and earn the right to represent the Riptide 
	crew. </li>
