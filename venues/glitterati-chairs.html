    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Glitterati (Kerith and Jaryn) are closely associated with luxurious and elite settings, most notably the Penthaüs venue.
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Themed Seating:</strong> As a high-end penthouse suite and 
	skyscraper, the venue features modern, high-fashion decor.</li>
	<li><strong> Character Animation:</strong> In cutscenes and character 
	introductions, The Glitterati are often depicted as aloof, high-
	fashion elitists. They may be seen posing in or near stylized 
	furniture that reflects their wealthy, "runway-inspired" 
	aesthetic.</li>
	<li><strong> Dynamic Setting:</strong> In Dance Central 2, the venue alternates 
	between an unfinished skyscraper and an elevator, reinforcing 
	the high-altitude, exclusive theme.</li>
