    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
        Invite Only is a residential-themed venue that serves as the home territory for the sister duo Flash4wrd (Taye and Li'l T)
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Location:</strong> The venue is Taye and Li'l T's childhood home, 
	identifiable by family photos of the sisters in the background.</li>
	<li><strong> Era:</strong> It represents the 1990s in the game's story mode.</li>
	<li><strong> Atmosphere:</strong> The setting is a casual house party with a "lived-in" feel. 
	In the campaign, Taye and Li'l T are shown hosting frequent parties that reportedly annoy their 
	parents and neighbors.</li>
	<li><strong> Role in Campaign:</strong> Agents from Dance Central Intelligence 
	(DCI) travel back to this 90s setting to learn the era's signature moves from 
	Flash4wrd.</li>
