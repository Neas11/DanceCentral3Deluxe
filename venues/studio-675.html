    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
       Studio 675 is a television studio set where the dance show "Dance Central Live" is filmed. It is the home venue for the Riptide Crew (Bodie and Emilia) and is associated with the 2000s era in the game's story mode.
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Theme:</strong> The setting is a brightly lit, professional TV studio with a 
	modern feel, appropriate for a 2000s-era music and dance show.</li>
	<li><strong> Features:</strong> It includes a main performance floor, camera equipment, and a backdrop with the logo for the fictional show 
	"Dance Central Live".</li>
	<li><strong> Atmosphere:</strong> Unlike some of the other gritty or retro venues in the game, Studio 675 has a clean, commercial, 
	and high-energy feel, designed to look like a popular broadcast show.</li>
