    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
        DCI HQ (Dance Central Intelligence Headquarters) serves as the primary 
        base of operations for the secret agency dedicated to stopping "dance crimes"
    </p>

 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Aesthetic:</strong> The venue is sleek, sophisticated, and high-tech, reflecting the agency's 
	modern 2010s era. Its primary color scheme is purple, matching the signature color of the DCI crew.</li>
	<li><strong> Time Machine:</strong> The facility houses a "convenient time machine" used by agents to travel to previous 
	decades (70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s) to learn historical dance crazes.</li>
	<li><strong> Control Center:</strong> It contains advanced computer systems that analyze criminal threats, such as Dr. Tan's
	mind-control helmets.</li>
	<li><strong> Training Floor:</strong> The venue doubles as a training ground where new recruits—including the player—are 
	briefed and tested on their skills by lead task analysts Rasa and Lima.</li>
