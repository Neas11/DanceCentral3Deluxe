    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Airship is a high-tech venue introduced in Dance Central 2, there is no official venue specifically named "The Airship Dark."
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Antagonist Base:</strong> It serves as the mobile fortress and 
	headquarters for Dr. Tan.</li>
	<li><strong> Themed Areas:</strong> The venue features a high-tech interior with a 
	command center and two large robotic arms that the player 
	dances between.</li>
	<li><strong> Atmosphere:</strong> It has an ominous, technicolor, and metallic look, 
	fitting for the final "boss" encounter of the game.</li>
	<li><strong> Destruction:</strong> In the Dance Central 2 storyline, once the player 
	defeats the D-Cypher crew, the Airship begins to combust and 
	is ultimately destroyed.</li>
