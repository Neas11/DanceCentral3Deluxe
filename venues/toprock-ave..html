    <h2>Venue Description</h2>
    <p>
        Toprock Ave. is an urban street venue that serves as the home base for the breakdancing crew Hi-Def (Mo and Glitch)
 <h2>Visual and Functional Design</h2>
 <ul>
    	<li><strong> Theme:</strong> The venue represents the 1980s era in the game's story mode and is designed 
	as a city street corner under construction.</li>
	<li><strong> Visuals:</strong> The location features exposed brick walls, scaffolding, and graffiti on the back wall, 
        including the "Hi Def" crew tag.</li>
	<li><strong> Name Origin:</strong> The name comes from "toprocking," a common style of breakdancing used in the game.</li>
	<li><strong> Details:</strong> The street signs at the corner read "Central Alley" and "Toprock Ave". 
	A car resembling the 1964 Chevrolet Suburban from the movie Back to the Future is also present, a nod to the 80s time-travel theme.</li>
