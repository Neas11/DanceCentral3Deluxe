    <h2>DCI Crew (Dance Central Intelligence)</h2>
    <p>
       The DCI Crew is an elite group of dancers created and overseen by Dance Central Intelligence, 
	an organization dedicated to analyzing and perfecting dance. Unlike other crews, DCI focuses 
	on technical accuracy, flawless timing, and controlled movements rather than personal 
	expression or style.

	Led by Dr. Tan, the DCI Crew treats dance as a science, using data and strict discipline to 
	achieve perfection. Their routines are highly synchronized and challenging, often designed to 
	push dancers to their limits. The crew represents the idea of mastery through structure and 
	precision, standing in contrast to more expressive and freestyle-focused crews in Dance Central 3.

	DCI serves as a major authority within the Dance Central universe and plays a key role in testing 
	and ranking dancers throughout the game.
