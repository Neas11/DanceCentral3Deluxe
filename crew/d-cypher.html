    <h2>D-Cypher</h2>
    <p>
	D‑Cypher is a robotic dance crew created by Dr. Tan, appearing in both Dance Central 2 and Dance Central 3. In DC3, they return as a selectable crew and appear in Spectator Mode, imports, and routines originally from DC2. D‑Cypher is a pair of humanoid robots created by Dr. Tan to be “perfect dancers.”
